## Firefox Profile Runner

This plugin allows you to launch firefox profiles from Krunner and your normal launcher.

The plugin uses a local copy of the firefox.desktop file. In this file it adds Desktop Action entries for
the profiles. Because of this you can search for the profiles in your normal launcher.  
For the changes in your firefox profiles to be applied you have to restart Krunner,
because the file only gets synced when the runner is initialized. 

*Within a few days a config dialog will be added.*  
If you have any issues please let me knowðŸ™‚.
